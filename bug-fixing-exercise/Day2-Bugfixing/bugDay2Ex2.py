"""
The programmer here is trying to convert the string "hello" to "HELLO" by using the upper() method:
    greeting = "hello"
    print(upper(greeting))

However, the program returns an error. Can you help fix the code, so it prints out HELLO?

"""

# Answer: The application of upper method is wrong. Correct use would be:

greeting = "hello"
print(greeting.upper())
